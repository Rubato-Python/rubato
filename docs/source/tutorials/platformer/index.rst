This tutorial shows you how to work with Game Objects and Components as well as explaining many game development basics.
By the end of this process, you will have all the tools you need to build any game you can think up!

This tutorial is split up into the following steps. To follow along, you will need these

We do not cover absolutely everything there is to know about rubato and game development here. We have
many more tutorials that cover more advanced topics ranging from custom components to compiling your game. More examples
and explanations will be coming soon!

At the bottom of each step, you will find the source code of everything we've done so far. You can also find the
completed game `here <https://github.com/rubatopy/rubato/blob/main/demo/platformer.py>`_.
